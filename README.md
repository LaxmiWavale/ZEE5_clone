Now we all have the ability to read others’ code.
How to work in a team.
How to be more efficient when there is a fixed time slot to complete the work.
How to communicate with each other through different methods like GitHub, WhatsApp, Slack, and Zoom meetings.
How to use GitHub, which will be useful for us when we will move to the industry as well.
